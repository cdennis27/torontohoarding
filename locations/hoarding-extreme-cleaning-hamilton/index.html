                            <p>Understanding the cost of hoarding cleanup can vary significantly depending on the extent
                                of the hoarding, the size of the property, and the specific services required. At THDS,
                                we offer personalized hoarding cleanup solutions tailored to meet the
                                unique needs of each situation in Hamilton.
                            </p>

                                Our pricing is determined after conducting a thorough assessment of the hoarding
                                environment. Factors such as the level of clutter, presence of hazardous materials, and
                                additional services like disinfection and decontamination are taken into account.
                            </p>

                                circumstances, we strive to offer competitive rates and transparent pricing. Our goal is
                                to provide efficient and compassionate hoarding cleanup services that restore the
                                property to a safe and habitable condition.

                                    Practice Self-Compassion: Be gentle with yourself throughout the cleaning process.
                                    Hoarding disorder is a complex mental health issue, and progress may take time.
                                    Remember that it's okay to ask for help when needed.

                        <h3 class="detailsSubtitle accentText">What are the 5 stages of hoarding?</h3>

                        <div>
                            <p>The 5 stages of hoarding, as recognized by mental health professionals, provide insight
                                into the progression of hoarding behavior:</p>

                            <p><strong class="strongAccentColor">1. Clutter Accumulation:</strong> The first stage
                                involves the gradual accumulation of possessions and belongings, often resulting in
                                cluttered living spaces. Individuals may struggle to discard items, leading to the
                                initial signs of hoarding behavior.</p>

                            <p><strong class="strongAccentColor">2. Excessive Acquisition:</strong> In this stage,
                                hoarders engage in excessive acquisition of items, often acquiring more possessions than
                                they can realistically use or store. Compulsive shopping, collecting free items, or
                                holding onto items others might consider worthless are common behaviors.</p>

                            <p><strong class="strongAccentColor">3. Difficulty Discarding:</strong> Hoarders experience
                                significant distress when faced with the prospect of discarding possessions, even those
                                with little or no practical value. They may fear losing important information or
                                memories associated with the items, leading to an inability to part with them.</p>

                            <p><strong class="strongAccentColor">4. Living Conditions Decline:</strong> As hoarding
                                behavior progresses, living conditions deteriorate further. Clutter and possessions may
                                overwhelm living spaces, impeding functionality and creating health and safety hazards.
                                Individuals may struggle to maintain basic hygiene and organization.</p>

                            <p><strong class="strongAccentColor">5. Social Isolation and Functional Impairment:</strong>
                                In the final stage, hoarding severely impacts an individual's social relationships,
                                functioning, and overall quality of life. Social isolation, strained relationships with
                                family and friends, financial problems, and legal issues may arise. Hoarders may
                                struggle to maintain employment or face eviction due to unsafe living conditions.
                            </p>

                            <p>Recognizing these stages can help individuals identify hoarding behavior early and seek
                                appropriate support and intervention. If you or someone you know is struggling with
                                hoarding tendencies, it's essential to reach out to mental health professionals or
                                hoarding specialists for assistance and guidance.
